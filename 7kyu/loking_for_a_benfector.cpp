/*
The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a
volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from
generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: 
[14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should
give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should 
reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he could 
have made a mistake.

Could you help him?

Task
The function should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) 
that will permit to reach the average.

Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us either to 
throw an error or return such value so he will clearly see that his expectations 
are not great enough.

In "Sample Tests" you can see what to return.

Notes:
all donations and new average are numbers (integers or floats), array of donations 
can be empty.

See examples below and "Sample Tests" to see which return is to be done.
